Tours & Travels Management System
This is a terminal-based Python application integrated with a MySQL database to manage travel agency operations efficiently. It provides a structured way for customers to book trips and for administrators to manage records.

Key Features
- Customer Booking: Users can register with their mobile number and book trips to Manali, Rishikesh, or Goa.

- Dynamic Pricing: The system calculates total costs based on seasonal packages, meal types (Jain or Regular), and adventure activities like skiing and camping.

- Booking Management: Customers can update their contact details, search for existing bookings, or cancel a trip to receive an 80% refund.

- Admin Tools: Secure login for administrators to view all active or cancelled bookings, delete records, and filter bookings by destination.

Technical Setup

- Language: Python.

- Database: MySQL (connected via pymysql).

- Auto-Initialization: The script automatically creates the necessary database (tat) and table (cust) upon the first run.

This project demonstrates core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and complex conditional logic for real-world business scenarios.
